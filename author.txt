Valery Sedletski is a microkernel enthusiast and OS/2 user. Participating
in osFree project (aiming to replace all OS/2 subsystems with opensource
analogues), including the kernel too. The kernel of choice is L4 
(originally, L4Ka::Pistachio, then target moved to L4/Fiasco and 
Fiasco.OC). Our "OS/2 personality" prototype is currently working 
under l4env, and port to Genode is in progress. My dream is an 
IBM Workplace OS reincarnation on new technological level 
(replacing Mach microkernel with Genode on top of L4 family 
kernels is a perfect choice).
